## The End Client
A modpack made by me for me (mostly).<br>
This is a simple client side quilt modpack for better performance and client side tweaks / qol improvements.<br>
I also would recommend [Astral Lex](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/astralex-shader-bsl-edit) Shader as Its very cool.
